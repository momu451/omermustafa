        <div class="card">
          <h3>USP</h3>
          <p>Risk-minded operator who treats vendors like levers, not partners. Machiavellian in structure, clinical in execution. I quantify impact, expose weak controls, and redesign contracts so leadership has certainty, not hope.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
          <p>Fewer suppliers, tighter SLAs, cleaner data flows, and regulators off your back. Ruthless on waste, surgical on controls. I turn fragmented stacks into accountable systems with clear ownership and measurable performance.</p>
